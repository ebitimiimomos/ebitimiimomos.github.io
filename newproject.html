            <p>
              From directing a thrilling horror movie, producing an engaging podcast , writing code, crunching data in excel sheets to creating websites, 
              I love challenging myself and I genuinely enjoy learning new skills and contributing to the success of every project I'm part of. In short, 
              I love to create and contribute. 
			<br>
			<br>
			People I have worked with in the past have described me as highly reliable, having a positive and enthusiastic approach to every task and a great team player, and I totally agree (not to toot my own horn or anything).
      I like to think of myself as a trustworthy individual with a strong work ethic and and a commitment to delivering results. I take pride in my ability to stay organized, meet deadlines, and consistently exceed expectations.
      <br>
      <br>
			I am currently embarking on my MSc in Data science and Artificial Intelligence. I am hoping to grow my knowledge and specialise in Javascript, PowerBI and Python related projects. 
      <br>
